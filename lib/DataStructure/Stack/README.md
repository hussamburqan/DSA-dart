# Stack<T> Implementation

## About LIFO Principle

LIFO stands for "Last In, First Out."  
It means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.  
Imagine a stack of plates: you add plates to the top, and you also remove plates from the top.

## How This Stack Works

This project implements a generic `Stack<T>` data structure using a `List` in Dart.

Supported operations:
- `push(T data)` – adds an element to the top
- `pop()` – removes and returns the top element
- `peek()` – returns the top element without removing
- `isEmpty()` – returns true if stack is empty
- `size()` – returns number of elements
- `clear()` – empties the stack
